# Identifying-Quantum-states-with-Machine-Learning

1) this repo is for prediction of pure quantum states (2-D) with projective measurement inputs.
   
2) The pre-trained model can be called into python via the testing pyfile, this needs to be updated BTW - doesn't have some important testing methods.
   
3) 3 pyfiles are for generating new data or for training or testing the model: use random gen data distribution, density matrices calc then measurement calc, in that order.
